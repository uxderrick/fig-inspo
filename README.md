## 🔧 Development Mode (Optional)

If you want to make changes to the plugin:

1. Run the watch command to automatically rebuild when you make changes:

   ```bash
   npm run watch
   ```

2. In Figma, you can reload the plugin by:
   - Closing the plugin panel
   - Re-running it from Quick Actions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Plugin not showing up in Figma?**

- Make sure you're using the Figma Desktop App, not the web version
- Try restarting Figma after installing the plugin

**"Command not found" error?**

- Make sure Node.js is properly installed
- Restart your Terminal/Command Prompt
- Try running `node --version` to check if Node.js is installed

**Build failed?**

- Make sure you're in the correct folder (the one with `package.json`)
- Try deleting `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again

**Images not loading?**

- This is expected - the plugin uses mock data for demonstration
- In a real implementation, you'd need a backend service to fetch real images

## 📝 Note

This plugin currently uses mock data for demonstration purposes. For production use, you would need to implement a backend service to fetch real images from design platforms while respecting their terms of service and API limits.
